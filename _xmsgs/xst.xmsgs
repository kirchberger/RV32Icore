<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="653" delta="new" >Signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">branchTrue</arg>&gt; is used but never assigned. This sourceless signal will be automatically connected to value <arg fmt="%s" index="2">GND</arg>.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="1767" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3218" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - The RAM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Mram_rdInMult</arg>&gt; will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings. Please refer to your documentation for coding guidelines.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3231" delta="new" >The small RAM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Mram__n0049</arg>&gt; will be implemented on LUTs in order to maximize performance and save block RAM resources. If you want to force its implementation on block, use option/constraint ram_style.
